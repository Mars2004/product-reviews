# Test Product Reviews Project

## Description

This is test project which is part of job interview. Not all edge cases are covered and some error handling might be better.

## Prerequisities

- Node.js (imlemented and tested with version 20.12.2)
- Nest.js (imlemented and tested with version 10.3.2)
- Docker (imlemented and tested with version 24.0.5)
- Docker Compose (imlemented and tested with version 1.25.0)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Prepare local environment
```bash
# initialize docker images/containers
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start
$ npm run start review-service

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
$ npm run start:dev review-service

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
$ npm run start:prod review-service
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Swagger

The project uses/generates `Swagger` in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`). `Swagger` is generated by `product-service`
and you can access it on this URL:
- http://localhost:3000/swagger

## Possible improvements

### Docker

The project uses `Docker` and `Docker Compose`. Used version are little outdated and it might be good idea to update those versions.

### Logging

Current version is logging to console only without logs persistence. On the other hand, it is just about configuration.
The project uses `Pino Logger` and it is possible to set any of supported streams (rotation files, sentry, etc.).

### Data Storage Module

I am used to (for historicall reasons) to have data (Entities, Repositories and Services) in one module with Controllers.
This project is implemented in this way, but it means some modules includes/injects at least Entity definition from another
module.

One shared module/library `data-storage`, which contains all Entities and theirs Repositories (for entities manipulation)
could be better solution. This module could be shared between all modules/micorservices which needs data manipulation.

### Message/Event handling

The project uses `RabbitMQ` for interprocess communication. Current implementation has just simple message/event delivery.
It might be good idea to set queue as durable, persistent and require consumer acknowledge (currently turned off) to
make message/event delivering more robust.

### Error Handling

The projects handles most of possible errors and edge cases, but not all of them. For example, database errors should
be translated to HTTP errors for production use.

### TODOs

The code contains some `TODOs`. They are ussually for reviewers to see what might be possible or what was considered,
but not implemented. Some `TODOs` can be about better error or data handling.

### Tests

The code and project are prepared for `unit tests` and `e2e test`, but in fact there are no real tests yet. Tests
should be implemented before production use.
